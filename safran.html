							<h2><i>1. Background and objectives of the project</i></h2>
							<p class="description">With a view to accelerating the production chain and developing assistance to
								the operator in charge of quality control, Safran's Innovation department
								Engineering Services (SES) wanted to introduce deep learning into this task. In addition, this allowed SES to have its first connection with deep learning technology.
								To do this, the neural network needed to be able to detect, recognise and segment
								surface defects (scratches, dents, etc...) on on-board cameras.</p>

							<h2><i>2. Achievements and activities</i> </h2>
							<p class="description">The network architecture and programming language have been imposed: Mask-RCNN and
							Python. <br> But during the development of the application, another network attracted the attention of
							: YOLACT++. <br>I worked alone on the project. Taking in hand the tools :	
							<li>Mask-RCNN (Keras)</li>
							<li>YOLACT++ (PyTorch)</li> 
							<li>Data collections Identification of customer needs</li> 
							<li>Data processing and labelling</li> 
							<li>Development of a model evaluation tool (mAP, Precision, Recall, Overlap)</li> 
							<li>Model training Deployment of a server/client application for Android
								(on-board camera)</li> 
							</p>

							<h2><i>3. Deliverables and results</i></h2>
							<p class="description">
							Proof of concept is accepted and a client has been found to assist in the control of quality.
							<li>Mask-RCNN :
								<li class="second">85% accuracy</li>
								<li class="second"> 75% recall</li>
								<li class="second"> Deployment of a client on Android (7s in 4g network and a GTX graphics card
									1080 8GB for the complete process: Sending of the image to the server, processing of the image and
									the image by the neural network, returns the result to be visualized on
									smartphone )</li>
							</li>
							<li>Yolact++ :
								<li class="second">67% of mAP but not the initial project, I had 1 month to take in hand
									the tool, for android deployment and training</li>
								<li class="second"> Deployment on live android (live streaming) with WiFi and a GTX 1080 8GB:
									can have up to 5s of latency and contains some lag (packet loss).</li>

							<h1 class="title">IMAGE PROCESSING</h1>
							<h2><i>1. Background and objectives of the project</i></h2>
							<p class="description">Also, SES has old wiring plans in paper format. With a view to migrating to the
								digital so that the plans can be saved and modelled on dedicated software. A
								technician is in charge of "copying" these electrical diagrams. Complex plans take
								up to a week to be copied, and it is estimated that there is a data entry error on the part of the
								technician at 5%. The aim of the innovation department is to assist the technician so that this
								is faster and safer. For this, it must be possible to detect the components in the diagrams,
								to know the relationships between components, to detect and recognise texts etc...</p>

								<h2><i>2. Achievements and activities</i> </h2>
								<p class="description">The application is also in Python, but uses more "classical" methods of image processing
									(OpenCV, Scikit-Image). We were 2 on the project:	
								<li>Pre-processing of the images (noise reduction, detection of the area of interest)</li>
								<li>Detect and recognise text (OCR, PyTesseract)</li> 
								<li>Establish relationships between components</li> 
								<li>Measures detection</li> </p>
	
								<h2><i>3. Deliverables and results</i></h2>
								<p class="description">
									Proof of concept is accepted and a potential client for the digital migration of
									paper plans:
									<li>The text is detected at 90-95% but is recognised at 75-85% depending on the plans.</li> 
									<li>If the component detection is correct, the establishment of the relationships between
										component is correct as well The area of interest is sometimes missed (none of the components
										statistics have been made)</li> 
									<li>Detection of measures still too random (deep learning)</li>
